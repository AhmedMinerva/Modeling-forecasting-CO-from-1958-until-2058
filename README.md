# Modeling-forecasting-CO-from-1958-until-2058
With the increase of global warming risk, it became crucial for us to estimate the carbon dioxide ratio over time and take the required steps to regulate the CO2 ratio in the air. In this paper, we are creating a statistical model that explains the CO2 ppm historical data set well and use it to forecast the CO2 ppm level in the future.
